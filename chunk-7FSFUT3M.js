Thus, Axis customers in government and critical infrastructure can be assured that their devices live up to the security levels defined by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and required by law. FIPS 140-3 certification assesses four levels of security. At Level 3, hardware is expected to prevent tampering, and access must be identity based. The embedded discrete secure element, EdgeLock\xAE SE052F, is from NXP\xAE Semiconductors, a world leader in secure connectivity solutions for embedded applications and known for its trusted security solutions, including securing today\u2019s smartphones, bank cards and passports."},{title:"",content:"Going forward, Axis will continue to expand its range of FIPS 140-3 certified devices by embedding the new secure element in all its upcoming network products. FIPS 140-3-compliance will be available for use cases ranging from surveillance to business optimization (through analytics), to access control, and audio. Even organizations that are not required to comply with the high FIPS standards will benefit as they can also be confident that their systems are interoperable and will meet long-term security requirements."},{title:"",content:"Ongoing investment in a portfolio equipped with industry-standard cryptographic computing modules is part of a multi-layer Axis strategy.  Secure storage and computing of cryptographic keys is just one component of the hardware-based cybersecurity platform Axis Edge Vault. Axis Edge Vault also includes features like secure boot, and the IEEE 802.1AR-compliant Axis device ID that verifies the identity and authenticity of Axis devices."}]},{img:"assets/images/brand/png/press/radiforce-rx670.png",title:"EIZO Releases 30-Inch, 6 Megapixel Medical Monitor with Streamlined USB Type-C Docking and Built-In Comfort Light for Radiology and Teleradiology",date:"01 AUGUST 2024",paragraphs:[{title:"",content:"EIZO Corporation (TSE: 6737) today announced the release of the RadiForce RX670 \u2013 a 30-inch 6 megapixel color monitor for diagnostic imaging in radiology and teleradiology. It offers USB Type-C\xAE docking for streamlining connectivity in the medical image reading environment."},{title:"",content:"The RadiForce RX670 is the successor model to the RX660. The monitor\u2019s large 30-inch wide screen displays 6 megapixels of information (3280 x 2048), allowing multiple medical images to be viewed simultaneously on a single screen for centralized viewing."},{title:"",content:"The monitor retains the high performance and rich features of its predecessor, including DICOM\xAE Part 14 compliance, while increasing the maximum brightness from 1000 cd/m2 to 1100 cd/m2. These combined features ensures gradation remains consistent in monochrome medical images such as chest X-rays, CT, or MRI. It also supports color display for reviewing images used in endoscopy, nuclear medicine, and ultrasound. This provides the flexibility to view and review data from multiple modalities in one location."},{title:"",content:"The RX670 is equipped with USB Type-C connectivity, which allows it to act as a docking station that can display video signals, transmit USB signals, and supply 94 watts of a power to a connected device, such as a mobile workstation, all with a single cable. This not only streamlines connectivity in traditional reading rooms, but also supports the needs of end users who are embracing the growing trends of teleradiology and home reading."}]},{img:"/assets/images/brand/png/press/optimizing_building.webp",title:"Optimizing buildings with technology",date:"02 JULY 2024",paragraphs:[{title:"",content:"Hybrid workplaces, transformation technologies, and shifts in societal and environmental priorities are factors shaping the evolution of commercial buildings. Internet of Things (IoT) devices are transforming the industry, making properties more efficient and providing the facility owners and managers with more and more insights. Now when it comes to the technology integration in commercial real estate space, open standards become crucial to leverage its full potential. An Axis solution is always based on open standards ensuring futureproofing and designed with an optimal total cost of ownership in mind. This offers more freedom when the needs or priorities change. You aren\u2019t locked into a proprietary system. Additionally, it\u2019s easy to scale up and down both the size of the system and the functionality of the solution."},{title:"",content:"With visual cameras, access control, audio, and analytics, you do not only create a top-notch security solution but also you get insight into your whole business performance."},{title:"",content:"Cameras working as sensors can help make informed decisions to run the buildings in optimal ways. Additional benefit of devices and analytics being built on open standards, is that they can be integrated with other systems for multiple purposes that helps operate buildings more cost efficiently. With the help of metadata from cameras, and insights from partner solutions dashboards can visualize data on occupancy levels in different areas and timings for example. Acting upon these insights enables smart use of heating, lighting, and air conditioning in your buildings, making buildings operate more cost-efficiently. "},{title:"",content:"Sustainability is becoming a key consideration with the ability to monitor and control energy usage, optimize temperature settings, and monitor air quality. These devices contribute to creating more sustainable and energy-efficient buildings. By leveraging IoT technology, commercial real estate can not only enhance security but also reduce environmental impact and achieve long-term sustainability goals.
